== Components ==
=== State ===
A State has a code and name.
=== Transition ===
A Transition consists of two States. One for the previous(current) State and one for the current(next) State.
{{{
final Transition transition = ...
final State previous = transition.getSource();
final State current = transition.getTarget();
}}}
=== Task ===
=== !TaskContext ===
TaskContexts are responsible to load Tasks.
=== Machine ===
Machines are responsible for holding current State and fire Transitions to MachineContext.
=== !MachineContext ===
MachineContexts are responsible to perform Tasks retrieved from TaskContext.
