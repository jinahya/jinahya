= Details =

This is a very simple dependency resolving utility.

For following dependency rules,
  * A depends on B and C
  * B depends on F
  * C depends on G
  * H depends on B
  * I depends on J and K
  * L depends on K
  * M depends on nothing
  * N depends on nothing
  * O depends on P and Q
  * P depends on R
  * Q depends on R
You can construct dependency resolver as follows.
{{{
final DependencyResolver<String> resolver =
    new DependencyResolver<String>();
resolver.addDependencies("A", "B", "C"); // single source to multiple targets
resolver.addDependency("B", "F"); // single source to single target
resolver.addDependencies("C", "G", null);
resolver.addDependency("H", "B");
resolver.addDependencies("I", "J", "K");
resolver.addDependency("L", "K");
resolver.addDependency("M", null); // null single target is allowed
resolver.addDependency("N", null);
resolver.addDependencies("O", "P", "Q");
resolver.addDependency("P", "R");
resolver.addDependencies("Q", "R");
// resolver.addDependencies("?", (String[]) null); // NPE
}}}
