= Introduction =
Simple (and somewhat restricted) XML parser/printer.

= Details =
This is a simple XML parser/printer. This artifact is not fully applicable to any XML libraries and there are some restrictions.

== Simple XML ==
  * There are only attributes, elements, and texts.
  * No other types are supported.
  * No ignorable white spaces.
  * No mixed content. Elements are always prior to texts.
  * And so on.

== Architecture ==
This library is just an thin wrapper for various in-memory XML parser models. You can use DOM, kXML2, JDOM, DOM4J, or XOM as underlying XML model.

== Sample XML ==
{{{
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<grandparent age="100" xmlns="http://www.example.org/family"
             xmlns:o="http://www.example.com/family/other">
  <parent age="50">
    <child age="30">
      <grandchild age="5" o:gender="male">John</grandchild>
      <o:spouse o:name="Marry">
    </child>
    <child age="26"/>
  </parent>
</grandparent>
}}}
