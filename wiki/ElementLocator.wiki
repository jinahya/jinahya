== Simple XML ==
  * There are only attributes, elements, and texts.
  * No other types are supported.
  * No ignorable white spaces.
  * No mixed content. Elements are always prior to texts.
  * And so on.

== Architecture ==
This library is just an thin wrapper for various in-memory XML parser models. You can use DOM, kXML2, JDOM, or XOM as underlying XML model.
