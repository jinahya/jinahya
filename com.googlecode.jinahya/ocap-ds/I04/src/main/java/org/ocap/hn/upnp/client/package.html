    Provides UPnP client functionality, permitting access to devices and
    services on a home network.
    
    <p>The UPnP Control Point class ({@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.client.UPnPControlPoint})
    provides access to devices discovered by the Host device during a UPnP discovery
    process as defined by the UPnP Device Architecture specification.
    As defined by UPnP, a device consists of a root device and 0 or more
    sub-devices.  Each device can contain services such as the Content Directory
    Service (CDS).  Each service can contain actions, e.g. CDS:Search, and state
    variables, e.g. CDS:SystemUpdateID.  The
    {@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.client.UPnPControlPoint#getDevices}
    method returns a data structure that represents the UPnP devices, services,
    etc., discovered in a home network.  The data structure returned matches the
    hierarchy of the discovered UPnP device documents.
    <p>In the
    <tt>org.ocap.hn.upnp.client</tt> package UPnP entities are represented as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>UPnP Device - {@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.client.UPnPClientDevice}</li>
        <li>UPnP Device Icon - {@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.client.UPnPClientDeviceIcon}</li>
        <li>UPnP Service - {@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.client.UPnPClientService}</li>
        <li>UPnP State Variable - {@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.client.UPnPClientStateVariable}</li>
    </ul>
    Objects of these types are immutable in order to represent entities that
    actually reside in remote Host devices.

    <p>Once an application calls the <code>UPnPControlPoint.getDevices()</code> method
    it can peruse the data structure returned, access the root device for a
    specific home network server and exhibit typical UPnP behaviors such as
    the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Evaluate device properties, services, and sub-devices.</li>
        <li>Evaluate service properties, actions, and state variables.</li>
        <li>Send an action and get a response.</li>
        <li>Subscribe to state variable events.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to typical UPnP behaviors an application can set itself using
    as the incoming and/or outgoing message handler using the
    <tt>UPnPControlPoint</tt>.  An incoming message handler can modify incoming
    messages before Host device evaluation.  An outgoing message handler can
    modify outgoing messages before transmission.  This is useful when,
    for instance, a server device sends non-standard properties in a verbose
    manner and an application needs to prune for various reasons.
