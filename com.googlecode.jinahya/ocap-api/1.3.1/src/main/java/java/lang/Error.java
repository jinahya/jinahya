/** 
 * An <code>Error</code> is a subclass of <code>Throwable</code> 
 * that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application 
 * should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions. 
 * The <code>ThreadDeath</code> error, though a "normal" condition,
 * is also a subclass of <code>Error</code> because most applications
 * should not try to catch it. 
 * <p>
 * A method is not required to declare in its <code>throws</code> 
 * clause any subclasses of <code>Error</code> that might be thrown 
 * during the execution of the method but not caught, since these 
 * errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur.
