Provides controls and events for the management of real-time media
in a television environment.
<br>The Java TV API uses the Java Media Framework (JMF) APIs for managing
the broadcast media pipeline.
<p>JMF defines javax.media.Player, which extends MediaHandler, for time-based
media data. A Player object encapsulates the state machine required to
acquire resources and manage the rendering of time-based media streams.
A Player object also provides various controls for the rendering facilities
(e.g., volume and video picture controls). Finally, in the case of a Player
for an audio/video stream, a GUI component object that contains the video
portion of the stream can be obtained from the Player. This allows integration
and placement of video with the rest of the presentation.
<p>This package defines extensions to JMF for use a television environment.
The DAVIC media package defines additional JMF extensions. For a detailed
description of JMF, see the JMF 1.0 specification.
