Provides a mechanism to select a <tt>Service</tt> for
presentation. The <tt>ServiceContext</tt> interface abstracts
receiver resources required to tune to and present the content of a
service, such a tuner, MPEG decoder, screen real estate, and
interactive content handlers. The <tt>ServiceContext.select()</tt>
method constitutes a high-level mechanism by which applications may
cause the receiver to tune to a desired service, demultiplex the
necessary service components, present the audio and video, and launch
any associated applications. Applications launched by the
<tt>ServiceContext.select()</tt> method are said to "run" within the
<tt>ServiceContext</tt>.<p>

Due to the scarce nature of the resources embodied by a
<code>ServiceContext</code>, implementations may limit the total
number of simultaneous <code>ServiceContext</code> objects to a very
small number, perhaps even one.  (<code>ServiceContext</code> objects
in the <em>destroyed</em> state do not count toward this total.)
Given appropriate security permissions, it is always possible to
access (via {@link
javax.tv.service.selection.ServiceContextFactory#getServiceContexts})
or create (via {@link
javax.tv.service.selection.ServiceContextFactory#createServiceContext})
at least one <code>ServiceContext</code> instance.<p>
