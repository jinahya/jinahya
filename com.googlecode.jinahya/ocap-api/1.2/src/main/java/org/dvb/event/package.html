Provides access to user input events before they
are processed through the event mechanism of the java.awt package.
<p>
The algorithm used for generating UserEvents by the MHP terminal when reporting 
user input to MHP applications shall be the same as that used for java.awt.event.KeyEvent. 
For example, pressing the Shift key will cause a KEY_PRESSED event with a VK_SHIFT keyCode, 
while pressing the 'a' key will result in a VK_A keyCode. After the 'a' key is released, a 
KEY_RELEASED event will be fired with VK_A, followed by a KEY_TYPED event with a keyChar 
value of 'A'.
