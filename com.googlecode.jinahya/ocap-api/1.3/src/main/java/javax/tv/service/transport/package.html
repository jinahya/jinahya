Provides additional information about the transport mechanisms that
deliver the content the SI data describes. The <tt>SIManager</tt>
provides access to instances of the <tt>Transport</tt> interface,
which is extended to represent an MPEG-2 multiplex.  The subtypes of
Transport are:
<ul>
<li>{@link javax.tv.service.transport.TransportStreamCollection},
representing one or more transport streams.  A {@link
javax.tv.service.transport.TransportStream} delivers services and
service information to the receiver.<p>

<li>{@link javax.tv.service.transport.NetworkCollection}, representing
one or more networks.  A {@link javax.tv.service.transport.Network}
typically aggregates transport streams.<p>

<li>{@link javax.tv.service.transport.BouquetCollection}, representing
one or more bouquets.  A {@link javax.tv.service.transport.Bouquet}
aggregates services, and may span transport stream and network
boundaries.
</ul>

One may use the {@link javax.tv.service.navigation.SIElementFilter
SIElementFilter} API to determine the services carried by individual
bouquets, networks, and transport streams.
