Provides APIs to navigate through services and hierarchical service information.
The Navigation package serves two main functions:
<ul>
<li>
It provides access to detailed SI data about each <tt>Service</tt>.</li>

<li>
It provides a mechanism to group Services based on various filtering criteria.</li>
</ul>
Additional information
about a service can be obtained through the <tt>ServiceDetails</tt> object.
In contrast to the <tt>Service</tt> interface, <tt>ServiceDetails</tt>
represents service meta-data that exists in the broadcast. It provides
such information as the description of the service, the service type and
the service components.

<p>A <tt>ServiceComponent</tt> represents an individual media or data
element associated with a <tt>Service</tt>. It can also be associated
with a <tt>ProgramEvent</tt> if such information is available. The current
<tt>ProgramEvent</tt> will provide <tt>ServiceComponent</tt> objects belonging
to the <tt>Service</tt> on which it is carried.

<p>The <tt>SIManager</tt> can also be used to generate a collection of
services called a <tt>ServiceList</tt> based on filtering criteria represented
by a <tt>ServiceFilter</tt> object. The filtering criterion may be a specific
network, transport stream, bouquet, user favorite services, <tt>Locator</tt>,
etc. A resulting <tt>ServiceList</tt> can be used to sort by service names
or numbers and to navigate through the <tt>Service</tt> objects it contains.
The base class <tt>ServiceFilter</tt> is extended to support predefined
filters such as the <tt>SIElementFilter</tt>, <tt>LocatorFilter</tt>, <tt>PreferenceFilter</tt>,
etc., which can used to create <tt>ServiceList</tt> objects based on various
filtering criteria. Applications may define custom filters by extending
the <tt>ServiceFilter</tt> class and overriding its <tt>accept()</tt> method.
If no <tt>ServiceFilter</tt> is specified for the filtering operation,
a default collection representing all services known to the receiver (the
"installed services") will be generated.
