 * This class provides a skeletal implementation of the <tt>Set</tt>
 * interface to minimize the effort required to implement this
 * interface. <p>
 *
 * The process of implementing a set by extending this class is identical
 * to that of implementing a Collection by extending AbstractCollection,
 * except that all of the methods and constructors in subclasses of this
 * class must obey the additional constraints imposed by the <tt>Set</tt>
 * interface (for instance, the add method must not permit addition of
 * multiple intances of an object to a set).<p>
 *
 * Note that this class does not override any of the implementations from
 * the <tt>AbstractCollection</tt> class.  It merely adds implementations
 * for <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt>.<p>
 *
 * This class is a member of the 
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../guide/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
