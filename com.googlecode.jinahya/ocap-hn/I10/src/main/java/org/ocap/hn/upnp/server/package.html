    Provides UPnP server functionality, permitting management of devices and services in the local Host device.

    <p>The UPnP Device Manager class ({@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.server.UPnPDeviceManager})
    provides the ability for an application to create devices and cause the Host device to
    expose them using the UPnP discovery process.  Application created devices
    are UPnP compliant and may contain services with actions and state
    variables.  An application uses the {@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.server.UPnPDeviceManager#createDevice UPnPDeviceManager.createDevice}
    method to create a device and passes in a {@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.server.UPnPManagedDevice} object
    that contains a hierarcy of objects that represents all of the device
    information including service ({@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.server.UPnPManagedService}) objects.  The
    object hierarchy matches the UPnP device architecture definition, e.g. a
    device contains sub-devices, and services.
    </p>

    <p>An application can set itself as an action handler by calling the
    {@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.server.UPnPManagedService#setActionHandler UPnPManagedService.setActionHandler(UPnPActionHandler)} method.  The application
    will be notified when an action request is received for the managed service.
    The application will create a response and return it to the Host
    implementation which will send the UPnP response.  Similarly, an application
    can set itself as a state variable handler by calling the
    {@link org.ocap.hn.upnp.server.UPnPManagedService#setHandler UPnPManagedService.setHandler(UPnPManagedStateVariableHandler)} method.  The application will
    be notified when a control point subscribes to or unsubscribes from the
    service or has requested the
    value of a state variable through the QueryStateVariable action.
