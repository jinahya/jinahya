Provides access to tuning - MPEG multiplex selection.
Note that in a digital TV system the role of tuning is different from its
role in an analog TV system. The service selection API in MHP provides
functionality closer to the role of tuning in an analog TV system.<p>
This javadoc has been edited to match the contents of the MHP
specification. The following errata agreed in DVB have been 
implemented with respect to the original DAVIC work.
<ul>
<li>NetworkInterfaceController.reserve() (DVB issue #776)<p>
Change the reason why a NoFreeInterfaceException is thrown to be
"raised if the requested network interface can not be reserved"
<li>NetworkInterfaceController.tune() (DVB issue #773)<p>
Replace "this NetworkInterface" with "the NetworkInterface reserved 
by this NetworkInterfaceController" in both signatures of this method.
<li>NetworkInterfaceController.reserve() (DVB issue #778)<p>
The following from the semantic of this method: <p>
If this NetworkInterfaceController has already reserved another NetworkInterface, then it will 
either release that NetworkInterface and reserve the specified one, or throw an exception.
If the specified NetworkInterface has already been reserved by this NetworkInterfaceController,
then this method does nothing.<p>
is replaced with the following:<p> 
If this NetworkInterfaceController has currently reserved another NetworkInterface, then it 
will either release that NetworkInterface and reserve an appropriate one, or throw an exception.
If a NetworkInterface that is able to tune to the specified transport stream is currently 
reserved by this NetworkInterfaceController, then this method does nothing.
<li>NetworkInterfaceController.reserveFor() (DVB issue #780)<p>
The following from the semantic of this method:<p>
If this NetworkInterfaceController has already reserved another NetworkInterface, then it will 
either release that NetworkInterface and reserve an appropriate one, or throw an exception.
If NetworkInterfaceController has already reserved a NetworkInterface that is able to tune to 
the specified transport stream, then this method does nothing.<p>
is replaced with the following:<p>
If this NetworkInterfaceController has currently reserved another NetworkInterface, then it 
will either release that NetworkInterface and reserve an appropriate one, or throw an exception.
If a NetworkInterface that is able to tune to the specified transport stream is currently 
reserved by this NetworkInterfaceController, then this method does nothing.
<li>NetworkInterface - Constructor (DVB issue #2554)
This class is considered to have a no argument protected constructor with the following 
statement attached to it:<p>
This constructor is provided for the use of implementations and specifications which extend 
this specification. Applications shall not define sub-classes of this class. Implementations 
are not required to behave correctly if any such application defined sub-classes are used.
