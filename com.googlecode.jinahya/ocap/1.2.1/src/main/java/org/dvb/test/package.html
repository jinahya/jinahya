<h1>
Broadcast model</h1>
In a broadcast-based conformance system, there are effectively three main
entities involved in an automated test process:
<ol>
<li>
The test server that is used to hold and initiate all of the tests.</li>

<li>
The test client which runs the tests and logs the results.</li>

<li>
The broadcast chain that is used to transfer applications and application
data from the server to the client.</li>
</ol>
<img SRC="doc-files/image001.gif" ALT="The broadcast / conformance test model" NOSAVE >
<p>The communication order is as follows:
<ol>
<li>
The test-server uses the "reset for next test" mechanism to set the test
client into a known default state, ready to receive the test-application.</li>

<li>
The test-server uses the "broadcast chain" mechanism to supply the test-application
to the test client and to signal that the test-application should be executed.</li>

<li>
The test-client runs the test-application.</li>

<li>
The test-application either:</li>

<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;finishes within a given timelimit, the result of the test is known
and shall be considered to be the value reported by the test application
for the purposes of compliance.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Optionally, the test-client may signal to the test-server that the test-application
has finished executing and that the test-client is ready to be reset in
order to receive the next test-application.</li>
</ul>

<li>
fails to finish the test-application within a given timeout, the result
of the test is unknown and shall be treated as a failure for the purposes
of compliance. The test-server may treat the test-client as ready to be
reset in order to receive the next application.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
[Successive tests are then repeated from stage 1.]
<h2>
"Reset for next test"</h2>
The "reset for next test" path is used by the test server to reset the
test client to receive the next test. The reset for next test API is considered
to be a private implementation issue between the test-server and test-client
and therefore has no public Java API implications. Note that this "communication"
needs to take place prior to any application being executed. Note that
the precise manner of the reset mechanism is intentionally not specified
-- in the worst case, this may involve "power cycling" the test client.
<h2>
Test log</h2>
Communication from the test client to the test log is considered as write-only
access. Hence, results from successive tests cannot overwrite results from
previous ones. Multiple (intermediate) results may be sent to the test
log for any given test. It is recommended that all communication to the
test log is synchronous.
<p>See the DVBTest.log method for details of the proposed API and implementation
issues.
<h2>
"Test completed"</h2>
The "test completed" path is used by the test client to indicate to the
test server that it has completed the previous test and is now able to
accept a subsequent one. Note that this communication path is an optimisation,
since direct communication from the client to the server is not actually
required, e.g. the server might simply "time-out" the client, and then
perform a "reset for next test" action. However, this optimisation may
be important when large numbers of tests are being performed on a "capable"
platform, since e.g. if a 30 second timeout is applied for 1000 test cases
which typically run within say 6 seconds, then the timeout implies a typical
running time of 500 minutes, i.e. ~4.5 hours --- rather than 100 minutes,
i.e. ~1.5 hours.
<p>See the DVBTest.terminate method for details of the proposed API and
implementation issues.
<h2>
Access test log</h2>
The mechanism by which the test-log is accessed is not considered in this
document, this is a private mechanism, which might include reading a file
from flash / RAM. Similarly, the mechanism by which results are recovered
from the test log is not considered in this document, e.g. the test-log
may actually reside on the test server, e.g. as in the case that results
are transmitted over an IP connection.
