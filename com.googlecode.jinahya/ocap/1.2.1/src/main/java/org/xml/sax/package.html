This package provides the core of the Java ME SAX API subset defined by JSR
280. The JSR 280 subset is backward compatible with the subset
defined by JSR 172, and excludes deprecated SAX1 APIs as well as some
SAX2 APIs not essential for Java ME. <br>
Note also that this code is based on the open source SAX APIs:

<h2> SAX2 Standard Feature Flags </h2>

<p> One of the essential characteristics of SAX2 is that it added
feature flags which can be used to examine and perhaps modify
parser modes, in particular modes such as validation.
Since features are identified by (absolute) URIs, anyone
can define such features.   
Currently defined standard feature URIs have the prefix
<code>http://xml.org/sax/features/</code> before an identifier such as
<code>validation</code>.  Turn features on or off using
<em>setFeature</em>.  Those standard identifiers supported by the 
JSR 280 subset are: </p>

	    Recommendation, which explicitly states that such attributes are
	    not in any namespace.

<p> Support for the default values of the
<em>namespaces</em> and <em>namespace-prefixes</em>
properties is required.
Support for any other feature flags is entirely optional.
</p>

<p> For default values not specified by SAX2,
each XMLReader implementation specifies its default,
or may choose not to expose the feature flag.
Unless otherwise specified here,
implementations may support changing current values
of these standard feature flags, but not while parsing.

</p>

<h2> SAX2 Standard Handler and Property IDs </h2>

<p> For parser interface characteristics that are described
as objects, a separate namespace is defined.  The
objects in this namespace are again identified by URI, and
the standard property URIs have the prefix
<code>http://xml.org/sax/properties/</code> before an identifier such as
<code>dom-node</code>.  Manage those properties using
<em>setProperty()</em>.  Those identifiers are: </p>

        <td>document-xml-version</td>
        <td> May be examined only during a parse, after the startDocument()
            callback has been completed; read-only. This property is a

            such as "1.0" or "1.1".
