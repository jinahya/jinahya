Provides a means for referencing data and resources accessible via the
Java TV APIs. The <tt>Locator</tt> interface serves as an opaque
reference to the location information of entities which are
addressable within a television receiver.  For example, locators
can reference broadcast filesystems, portions of service information,
sources of audio/video content, and interactive applications.

<p>
A given locator may
represent transport-independent data and have multiple mappings to
transport-dependent locators. Methods are provided for discovery of
such circumstances and for transformation to transport-dependent
locators.

<p>
An instance of <tt>Locator</tt> that references a <code>Service</code>
or <code>ServiceComponent</code> can be converted to a
<tt>javax.media.MediaLocator</tt> instance through use of the method
<tt>Locator.toExternalForm()</tt>.
