Provides the classes and interfaces for the security framework.
This includes classes that implement an easily configurable,
fine-grained access control security architecture.
This package also supports
the generation and storage of cryptographic public key pairs,
as well as a number of exportable cryptographic operations
including those for message digest and signature generation.  Finally,
this package provides classes that support signed/guarded objects
and secure random number generation.

Many of the classes provided in this package (the cryptographic
and secure random number generator classes in particular) are
provider-based.  The class itself defines a programming interface
to which applications may write.  The implementations themselves may
then be written by independent third-party vendors and plugged
in seamlessly as needed.  Therefore application developers may
take advantage of any number of provider-based implementations
without having to add or rewrite code.
