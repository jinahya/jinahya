OCAP testing communications.
<p>
OCAP testing requires the test applications executing on OCAP devices be
able to communicate with an Automated Test Environment (ATE) in a
manufacturer-independent manner. This differs from the MHP test
environment, in which MHP device manufacturers provide
manufacturer-specific implementations to communicate between an ATE and
an MHP device. The need to communicate with an ATE in a manufacturer-
independent manner indicates that the OCAP devices SHALL communicate
with the ATE using a common, defined communications mechanism.

</p>
<p>
Since OCAP devices, by definition, must support TCP/IP and UDP/IP for
interaction channel protocols, TCP/IP and UDP/IP sockets have been
chosen as the mechanism by which OCAP devices will communicate with an
OCAP ATE. The interaction channel provides either TCP/IP or UDP/IP
protocol, via the RF connector labeled 'Cable In' on the OCAP Host
Device, and the CableCARD. Though the OCAP Host Device supports both
TCP/IP and UDP/IP, only one of them SHALL be used for the ATE, according
to the type of CableCARD, once communication between the ATE and Host
device has been established (see item b) below).

<h2>OCAP compliance testing </h2>
Due to the large number of OCAP Host Devices which are expected to be 
made available by manufacturers during certification testing "waves", 
OCAP compliance testing will need to be able to take advantage of a 
common, scalable hardware infrastructure. 
<br>
The proposed connectivity diagram is shown below in Figure W-1:

This diagram is intended to show how multiple ATEs can be connected on a common
IP network with multiple OCAP Host Devices. On the left is a single Out-Of-Band
(OOB) channel which can transmit a location of a common test Monitor
Application to all OCAP Host Devices being tested. In-band (IB) delivery
channels are used to stream test applications, and are controlled by a particular
ATE instance. All of these IB and OOB channels are multiplexed onto a common RF
cable which is shared by all OCAP Host Devices being tested. <br>
Each OCAP Host Device that is being tested is associated with a test harness
comprised of reset, IR, and media capture subsystems. These subsystems are
controlled by a particular ATE instance. The ATE instances are shown on the
right side of the drawing. <br>
At configuration time, an instance of the ATE is associated with a particular
IB delivery channel, an OCAP Host Device being tested, and its associated test
harness components. <br>
During compliance testing, a particular OCAP Host Device establishes a
communication channel with a particular instance of the ATE. The ATE is
responsible for preparing test applications to be loaded onto the OCAP Host
Device (via its associated IB delivery channel), and for responding to requests
made by test applications executing on the OCAP Host Device being tested. </p>


<p>
<p>The scenario for establishing communications between an OCAP Host Device
being tested and an ATE is as follows (details are addressed in the CableLabs'
ATE documentation): <br>
a) The ATE uses the &quot;reset for next test&quot; mechanism to set the OCAP
Host Device being tested into a known default state, ready to receive the
test-application. This involves a power-cycle of the OCAP Host Device being
tested. <br>
b) The ATE begins sending IP datagrams to the IP address of the OCAP Host
Device it is associated with. <br>
c) The OCAP Host Device powers up out of reset and reads an XAIT from the out-of-band
communications channel, signaling the OCAP Host Device to load a Test Monitor
Application (an unbound application) from an in-band communications channel. <br>
d) The Test Monitor Application invokes <code><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>OcapSystem.monitorConfiguredSignal()</span></code>
to enable conformance testing APIs (<code><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>org.ocap.test.OCAPTest</span></code>).
When monitorConfiguredSignal is called, the implementation will enable the
conformance testing APIs (see <a
href="../OcapSystem.html#monitorConfiguredSignal">org.ocap.OcapSystem.monitorConfiguredSignal</a>
for details and OCAP testing communications below). <br>
e) Test Monitor Application requests configuration parameters including
information on the initial channel to tune to using the communications channel
established in step c. <br>
f) Tuning to the specified channel initiates a service containing the bound
testlet application. <br>
g) Test application executes on OCAP Host Device, communicating with the ATE as
required via the communications channel opened up in step c. </p>

<h2>OCAP testing communications</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal>OCAP testing requires that test applications executing on
OCAP devices be able to communicate with an Automated Test Environment (ATE) in
a manufacturer-independent manner. The need to communicate with an ATE in a
manufacturer-independent manner means that OCAP Host Devices SHALL communicate
with the ATE using a common, bi-directional interaction channel. In an effort
to isolate OCAP Host Device implementations from the need to implement
interaction channel protocols, which are necessary only for use in compliance testing,
the class <code><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>org.ocap.test.OCAPTest</span></code>
has been defined. This class presents an API to test framework classes which
can be used for compliance testing. The conceptual diagram of this
communications structure is presented below: </p>
