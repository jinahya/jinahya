This package defines a central registry for all DVB Service Provider Interface
(SPI) providers.  This encourages a consistent architecture for such providers.
Additionally, it gives some support for debugging.  For example, a list of
installed providers might be useful in a crash log.
</p><p>
In normal operation, xlets using a provider never get a direct reference
to that provider.  Rather, xlets interact with the terminal through
standardized APIs, such as Java TV.  The service underlying those
underlying APIs can be:
<ul>
  <li>An integrated part of the implementation, or
  <li>interoperable downloaded code, either in the form of an 
      xlet-bound or a system-bound provider.  
</ul>
</p><p>
NOTE:  The Java platform class <code>java.security.Provider</code> is
unrelated to the providers defined in this package and its subpackages.
Additionally, <code>java.security.Provider</code> in the Java platform
is typically associated with a completely different lifecycle model.
