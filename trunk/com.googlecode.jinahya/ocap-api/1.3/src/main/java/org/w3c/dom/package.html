The org.w3c.dom package provides the Java ME DOM API defined by
      JSR 280.  The API is derived from the W3 DOM2 API Java
      bindings source
      (http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/java-binding.zip), and
      the DOM3 API Java bindings source
      (http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/java-binding.zip). The
      initial version of the JSR 280 modifications was published on 5
      May 2006.
