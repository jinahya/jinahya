<P>Provides classes and interfaces for the input method framework.
This package enables text editing components to receive text input
through input methods. Input methods are software components that let
the user enter text in ways other than simple typing on a keyboard.
They are commonly used to enter Japanese, Chinese, or Korean -
languages using thousands of different characters - on keyboards with
far fewer keys. However, the framework also supports input methods
for other languages and the use of entirely different input
mechanisms, such as handwriting or speech recognition.</P>
