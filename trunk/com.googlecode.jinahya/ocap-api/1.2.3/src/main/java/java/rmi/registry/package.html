Provides <em>APIs related to</em> the RMI registry.
A registry is a remote object that maps names to remote objects.  A
server registers its remote objects with the registry so that they can
be looked up.  When an object wants to invoke a method on a remote
object, it must first lookup the remote object using its name.  The
registry returns to the calling object a reference to the remote
object, using which a remote method can be invoked.
