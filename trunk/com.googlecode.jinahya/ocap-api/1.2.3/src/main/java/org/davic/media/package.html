<li>InvalidEventIDException
<li>InvalidEventNameException
<li>MediaTimeEvent
<li>MediaTimeEventControl

The following errata agreed in DVB have been implemented with respect to the original DAVIC work.
<ul>
<li>MediaTimePositionChangedEvent. (DVB issue #121) <p>
Add the following constructor:
<code>MediaTimePositionChangedEvent (Controller from, int previous, int current, int target, Time mediaTime)</code>
<li>FreezeControl.resume (DVB issue #754)<p>
The following is added to the description of this method.<p>
If the player is started and if decoding of the media stream is not frozen then calls to this 
method shall have no effect otherwise an exception is thrown.
<li>NotAuthorizedMediaException (DVB issue #770)<p>
The standard constructors for this exception, a no-argument one and one with a single
'reason' parameter have been removed and replaced with appropriate ones. The new ones
enable values to be passed in for the various 'get' methods in the exception.
<li>FreezeControl.resume (DVB issue  #2363)<p>
In the description of this method (as modified by DVB issue #754), replace<p>
If the player is started and if decoding of the media stream is not frozen then calls to this 
method shall have no effect otherwise an exception is thrown.<p>
With<p>
If the player is started and if decoding of the media stream is not frozen then calls to this 
method shall have no effect.<p>If the player is not started then the exception shall be thrown.
<li>MediaTimePositionChangedEvent - Constructor (DVB issue #2820)<p>
Add the following definitions for the parameters of this constructor
from - the controller whose media position was changed previous 
previous - the state the controller was in before this event current 
current - the state the controller was in at the time the event was generated target 
target - the state that the controller is heading to mediaTime 
mediaTime - the media time after the change
<li>NotAuthorizedMediaException - Constructors (DVB issue #770, #776, #2696, #2821, #2696)<p>
Existing constructors replaced by <p>
NotAuthorizedMediaException( org.davic.mpeg.Service, int reason ) <p>
NotAuthorizedMediaException( org.davic.mpeg.ServiceElementaryStream[], int reason[] )<p>
NotAuthorizedMediaException( org.davic.mpeg.ElementaryStream[], int[], int[] )<p>
NotAuthorizedMediaException(Service, int major_reason,int minor_reason)<p>
<li>LanguageControl (DVB issue #2281)
The following description of semantics is considered to be present:<p>
If more than one stream with the same language exists, the behaviour of 
selectLanguage(String)is to select the first listed in the network signalling. 
NOTE:This is equivalent to item b under 11.4.2.3,"Default media player behaviour".
