The following errata agreed in DVB have been implemented with respect
to the original DAVIC work.
<ul>
<li>The no-argument constructor for org.davic.net.Locator is considered to not be present.
The absence of any description on the method indicates that this was an editing error in 
the DAVIC specificiation. (DVB issue #845).
<li>Locator.toExternalForm() (DVB issue #848)<p>
This method is considered to have the following text appended to its description : 
"If the instance of Locator has been created using Locator(java.lang.String url)
and the URL is a non-null invalid URL the behaviour is implementation dependent."
</ul>
