Provides access to IP datagrams transmitted in the broadcast stream.
Applications implemented using the Java TV API can access IP datagrams
transmitted in the broadcast stream through use of the normal datagram
reception mechanisms of the <tt>java.net</tt> package. Unicast IP datagrams
are received via the <tt>java.net.DatagramSocket</tt> class; multicast
IP datagrams are received via the <tt>java.net.MulticastSocket</tt> class.
<p>To enable reception of multicast IP datagrams, the Java TV API assigns
a locally-unique IP address to service components carrying encapsulated
IP datagrams. These addresses are generated dynamically from the set of
IP addresses reserved for use in private networks (see RFC 1918 for more
information). Television applications determine the local IP address assigned
to a given service component using the class <tt>javax.net.InterfaceMap</tt>.
Applications then use this IP address to indicate the network interface
from which instances of <tt>java.net.MulticastSocket</tt> or <tt>java.net.DatagramSocket</tt>
receive multicast datagrams.
