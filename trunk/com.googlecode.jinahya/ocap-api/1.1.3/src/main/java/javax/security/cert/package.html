Provides classes for public key certificates.

<P>

These classes include a simplified version of the
java.security.cert package.  These classes were developed
as part of the Java Secure Socket
Extension (JSSE).  When JSSE was added to the Java 2 SDK, this
package was added for backward-compatibility reasons only.

<P>

New applications should not use this package, but rather
java.security.cert.
